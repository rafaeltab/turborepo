# Beginners guide

If you just start working with Turborepo and monorepos there are a lot of things you'll have to figure out. We want to make this process a little easier by providing answers to some basic questions.

## Installing packages

A common issue beginners are facing is the installing of packages in a specific workspace.
When not working in a monorepo you can simply run `npm install <package>` but now that installs that in the root.
No when you go in the folder of a workspace and run that command the entire `node_modules` folder will also end up there.
So how do you install a package?

Well you run the following commands for the following package managers:

| Package manager | Command                                    | Example                        |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| npm             | `npm install <package> -w=<workspace>`     | `npm install react -w=web`     |
| yarn            | `yarn workspace <workspace> add <package>` | `yarn workspace web add react` |
| pnpm            | `pnpm add <package> --filter <workspace>`  | `pnpm add react --filter web`  |
