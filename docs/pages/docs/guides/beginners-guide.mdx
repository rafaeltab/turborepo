# Beginners guide

If you just start working with Turborepo and monorepos there are a lot of things you'll have to figure out. We want to make this process a little easier by providing answers to some basic questions.

## Installing packages

A common issue beginners are facing is the installing of packages in a specific workspace.
When not working in a monorepo you can simply run `npm install <package>` but now that installs that in the root.
No when you go in the folder of a workspace and run that command the entire `node_modules` folder will also end up there.
So how do you install a package?

Well you run the following commands for the following package managers:

| Package manager | Command                                    | Example                        |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| npm             | `npm install <package> -w=<workspace>`     | `npm install react -w=web`     |
| yarn            | `yarn workspace <workspace> add <package>` | `yarn workspace web add react` |
| pnpm            | `pnpm add <package> --filter <workspace>`  | `pnpm add react --filter web`  |

## Adding workspaces

Another common issue is that users don't know how to add a workspace to the monorepo.

To add a workspace you need a few things.

1. A folder for your workspace
2. Something that indicates that a folder is a workspace
3. A `package.json` file in the workspace folder

### A folder for your workspace

First you need to decide where you want to put your workspace.
A common pattern is to have an `apps` folder and a `packages` folder.
The `apps` folder will contain workspaces that house launcheable apps, such as a next.js app.
The `packages` folder will contain workspaces that house packages that are used by either an app or another package.

When you have decided where to put the workspace you simply create a folder for it.

### Something that indicates that a folder is a workspace

After creating your folder you need to make sure your package manager knows that your folder is a workspace folder.

This step is different for `pnpm` than it is for `npm` and `yarn`.

For `pnpm` you need to add the folder to the `pnpm-workspace.yaml` file that exists in your root.
This file contains a list of workspaces in the form of globs.

For `yarn` and `npm` you need to add the folder to the `workspaces` field in the root `package.json` file
This field contains a list of workspaces in the form of globs.

Each folder that matches any of the globs in the lists is considered a workspace folder.

### A `package.json` file in the workspace folder

After creating the folder and adding it to the list of workspaces we want to create the `package.json` file for the workspace.
This `package.json` file will house all the information for the workspace such as the version, dependencies, and scripts, just like a normal `package.json` file would.
