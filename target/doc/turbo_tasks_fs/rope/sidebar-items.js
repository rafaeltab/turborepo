Cloning a Rope is extremely cheap (Arc and usize), and the sharing contents of one Rope can be shared by just cloning an Arc."],["RopeBuilder","RopeBuilder provides a mutable container to append bytes/strings. This can also append other Rope instances cheaply, allowing efficient sharing of the contents without a full clone of the bytes."],["RopeReader","Implements the Read/AsyncRead/Stream/Iterator trait over a Rope."],["RopeVc","Vc for [`Rope`]"]],"type":[["RopeReadRef","see [turbo_tasks::ReadRef]"]]};
